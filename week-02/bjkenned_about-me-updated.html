        <h1> Kennedy, Brett</h1>
        <p> My name is Brett Kennedy and <strong>I am currently a second semester senior</strong> here at Syracuse University.
            In my first two years here at SU I was enrolled in the <em>College of Arts and Sciences</em> before intra-transferring 
            into the ischool. Over the past couple years I have really enjoyed my time completing my degree in information
            technology and management and am looking forward to graduation this spring.<br/></p>
        <p> Here at Syracuse university, I am a member of the men's lacrosse team and play defense.
            Upon graduation this spring, I still have a year of athletic eligibility remaining so I have decided that I am going 
            to return to <strong><em><u>Syracuse for a fifth year and pursue a graduate program.</u></em></strong>strongThis will be great because I will be able to 
            pursue further learning in work I am interested in learning more about. At the same time, I will also be able to play
            lacrosse at SU for one more year which I am very happy about. </p>
        <p>I can't wait to play <abbr title="Lacrosse">LAX</abbr> during my fifth year next year. </p>
